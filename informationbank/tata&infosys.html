TATA &amp; SUDHA MURTHY <span> </span></span></b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">Really very inspiring……. </span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <br />It was probably the April of 1974. Bangalore was getting
warm and glamorous were blooming at the IISc campus. I (Sudha Murthy) was the only girl in my
postgraduate department and was staying at the ladies' hostel. Other girls were
pursuing research in different departments of Science. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">I was looking forward to going abroad to complete
a Doctorate in computer science. I had been offered scholarships from Universities
in the US.
I had not thought of taking up a job in India. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">One day, while on the way to my hostel from our Lecture-hall
complex, I saw an advertisement on the notice board. It was a Standard
job-requirement notice from the famous automobile company Telco (Now Tata Motors). It stated that the company required
young, bright engineers, Hardworking and with an excellent academic background,
etc. </span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">At the bottom was a small line: "Lady
Candidates need not apply."</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">I read it and was very upset. For the first time
in my life I was up against gender discrimination. Though I was not keen on
taking up the job, I saw it as a challenge. I had done extremely well in
academics, better than most of my male peers. Little did I know then that in
real life academic Excellence is not enough to be successful?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">After reading the notice I went fuming to my room.
I decided to inform the topmost person in Telco's management about the injustice
the company was perpetrating. I got a postcard and started to write, but there
was a problem: I did not know who headed Telco.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">I thought it must be one of the Tatas. I knew JRD Tata
was the head of the Tata Group; I had seen his pictures in newspapers (actually,
Sumant Moolgaokar was the company's chairman then). I took the card, addressed
it to JRD and started writing. To this day I remember clearly what I wrote.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">"The great Tatas have always been pioneers.
They are the people who started the basic infrastructure industries in India,
such as iron and steel, chemicals, textiles and locomotives. They have cared
for higher education in India
since 1900 and they were responsible for the establishment of the Indian
Institute of Science. Fortunately, I study there. But I am surprised how a
company such as Telco is discriminating on the basis of gender."</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">I posted the letter and forgot about it. Less than
10 days later, I Received a telegram stating that I had to appear
for an interview at Telco's Pune facility at the company's expense. I was taken
aback by the telegram. My hostel mate told me I should
use the opportunity to go to Pune free of cost and buy them the famous Pune
saris for cheap! I collected Rs 30 each from everyone who wanted a sari. When I
look back, I feel like laughing at the reasons for my going, but back then they
seemed good enough to make the trip.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">It was my first visit to Pune and I immediately
fell in love with the city.To this day it remains dear to me. I feel as much
at home in Pune as I do in Hubli, my hometown. The place changed my life in so many
ways. As directed, I went to Telco's Pimpri office for the interview.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">There were six people on the panel and I realised
then that this was Serious business.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">"This is the girl who wrote to JRD," I
heard somebody whisper as soon as I entered the room. By then I knew for sure that
I would not get the job. The realisation abolished all fear from my mind, so I was
rather cool while the interview was being conducted. Even before the interview
started, I reckoned the panel was biased, so I told them, rather impolitely,
"I hope this is only a technical interview." They were taken aback by
my rudeness, and even today I am ashamed about my attitude. The panel asked me technical questions
and I answered all of them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">Then an elderly gentleman with an affectionate
voice told me, "Do you know why we said lady candidates need not apply?
The reason is that we have never employed any ladies on the shop floor. This is
not a co-ed college; this is a factory. When it comes to academics, you are a
first ranker throughout. We appreciate that, but people like you should work in
research laboratories."  </span></b></p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"></span></b><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">I was a young girl from small-town Hubli. My world
had been a limited </span></b>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">place. I did not know the ways of large corporate
houses and their difficulties, so I answered, "But you must start
somewhere, otherwise no woman will ever be able to work in your
factories."</span></b></p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">Finally, after a long interview, I was told I had
been successful. So this </span></b>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">was what the future had in store for me. Never had
I thought I would take up a job in Pune. I met a shy young man from Karnataka
there, we became good friends and we got married.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">It was only after joining Telco that I realized
who JRD was: the uncrowned king of Indian industry. Now I was scared, but I did
not get to meet him till I was transferred to Bombay. One day I had to show some reports to
Mr Moolgaokar, our chairman, who we all knew as SM. I was in his office on the first
floor of BombayHouse (the Tata headquarters) when, suddenly JRD walked in. That
was the first time I saw "appro JRD". Appro means "our" in
Gujarati. This was the affectionate term by which people at BombayHouse called
him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black">I was feeling very nervous, remembering my
postcard episode. SM introduced me nicely, "Jeh (that's what his close
associates called him), this young woman is an engineer and that too a
postgraduate. She is the first woman to work on the Telco shop floor." JRD
looked at me. I <span> </span>was praying
he would not ask me any questions about my interview (or <span></span>the postcard
that preceded it).  </span></b></p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>Thankfully,
he didn't. Instead, he remarked. "It is nice that girls </span></b>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>Are getting
into engineering in our country. By the way, what is your</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>name?"</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <span></span>"When
I joined Telco I was Sudha Kulkarni, Sir," I replied. "Now I am<span> </span>Sudha Murthy."
He smiled and kindly smile and started a discussion with SM.As for me, I almost
ran out of the room. After that I used to see JRD on and off. He was the Tata Group
chairman and <span> </span>I was merely an engineer.
There was nothing that we had in common. I was in awe of him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <span> </span>One day I
was waiting for Murthy, my husband, to pick me up after<span> </span>Office
hours. To my surprise I saw JRD standing next to me. <span></span>I did not know how to react. Yet again I
started worrying about that postcard. Looking back, I realise JRD had forgotten
about it. It mustHave been a small incident for him, but not so for
me.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>"Young
lady, why are you here?" he asked. "Office time is over."<span> </span>I said, “Sir,
I'm waiting for my husband to come and pick me up." JRD said, “It is
getting dark and there's no one in the corridor.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>I'll wait
with you till your husband comes."</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>I was quite
used to waiting for Murthy, but having JRD waiting</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>Alongside
made me extremely uncomfortable.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <span> </span>I was nervous. Out of the
corner of my eye I looked at him. He wore a<span> </span>Simple white pant and
shirt. He was old, yet his face was glowing. There wasn’t any air of
superiority about him. I was thinking, "Look at this person. He is a
chairman, a well-respected man in our country and he is waiting for the sake of
an ordinary employee."</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span></span>Then I saw Murthy and I
rushed out. JRD called and said, "Young lady, tell your husband never to
make his wife wait again."</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>In 1982 I had to resign
from my job at Telco. I was reluctant to go,<span> </span>but I <span> </span>really did not have a choice. I was coming
down the steps of Bombay
House after wrapping up my final settlement when I saw JRD coming up. He was
absorbed in thought. I wanted to say goodbye to him, so I stopped. He saw me
and paused.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <span> </span>Gently, he said, "So
what are you doing, Mrs. Kulkarni?" (That was the way he always addressed
me.) "Sir, I am leaving Telco."</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <span> </span>"Where are you
going?" he asked. "Pune, Sir. My husband is starting a<span> </span>Company called Infosys and
I'm shifting to Pune."</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <span></span>"Oh! And what will you
do when you are successful."</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>"Sir, I don't know
whether we will be successful."</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>"Never start with
diffidence," he advised me. "Always start with<span> </span>confidence. When you are
successful you must give back to society.<span> </span>Society gives us so much;
we must reciprocate. I wish you all the<span> </span>best."</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"> <br /><span> </span>Then JRD continued walking
up the stairs. I stood there for what<span> </span>seemed like a millennium.
That was the last time I saw him alive. Many years later I met <span> </span>Ratan Tata in the same Bombay House, occupying the chair JRD once
did. <span> </span>I told him of my many sweet
memories of working with Telco. Later, he wrote to me, "It was nice
hearing about Jeh from you. The sad part is that he’s not alive to see you
today." </span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;color:black"><span> </span>I consider
JRD a great man because, despite being an extremely busy<span> </span>Person, he
valued one postcard written by a young girl seeking justice. He must have received
thousands of letters everyday. He could have thrown mine away, but he didn't do
